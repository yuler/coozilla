	<p>Privacy Statement</p><p>Coozilla respects your privacy. Coozilla Limited, including its affiliates ("Coozilla") provides this Privacy Statement (the "Statement") to help you understand how Coozilla collects and uses the Personal Information and Non-Personal Information (each as defined below) you submit in connection with the Coozilla (referred to as the "Service") and that is collected when you use the Service. "You" means an individual who accesses or uses the Service.</p><p><br></p><p>This Statement only governs the collection and use of information collected through the Service. It does not apply to information collected in other ways or to any other Coozilla websites, products, software or services, and it does not modify or alter other agreements you may have, or enter later, with Coozilla. For example, if Coozilla collects information about you from third party sources, the collection and use of that information will be governed by Coozilla's agreement with you or the source, unless the privacy statement of a third party source indicates that this Statement will govern Coozilla's use of your Personal Information that the third party source provides to Coozilla. Also, if you provide Personal Information to Coozilla through other means, such as when you call customer service or send Personal Information related to promotions or product registrations via postal mail, this Statement does not apply to that information. This Statement does not apply to the data collection and use practices of any third parties you may contract with using or in connection with the Service, including third party application providers, your internet provider and your wireless carrier.</p><p><br></p><p>By accessing or using the Service or providing information to Coozilla through the Service, you are accepting the practices described in this Statement.</p><p><br></p><p>In addition to this Statement, for certain features of the Service, promotions or special offers, Coozilla may present different or additional information practices and terms specific to those programs at the time the information is collected.</p><p><br></p><p>1. Information that Coozilla Collects</p><p><br></p><p>Coozilla collects information when you choose to submit it to Coozilla as well as when you use the Service.</p><p><br></p><p>Personal Information You Submit.</p><p><br></p><p>In this Statement, "Personal Information" means any information about an identifiable individual, as further defined under applicable laws. Coozilla collects Personal Information that you submit using the Service (for example when you allow the application to access your Personal Information on your Twitter profile). The Personal Information collected may include your Twitter username, name, profile image, location, and other specific Personal Information, as well as information about your followers and friends on Twitter. In some cases, the Personal Information Coozilla asks you to provide will be mandatory to participate in a particular activity, service or promotion. If you do not provide this Personal Information, your participation in that activity, service or promotion may be limited or prohibited.</p><p><br></p><p>2. Coozilla's Use of Information</p><p><br></p><p>Coozilla and/or its service providers will use the Personal Information collected to provide you with the Service.</p><p><br></p><p>By using the Service, you consent to the transfer of information outside of the country where you reside, including jurisdictions that may not have data privacy laws that provide equivalent protection to such laws in your home country.</p><p><br></p><p>Your acceptance of the Coozilla Terms and Conditions includes your agreement to this Privacy Statement and is consent to all the uses of your information set out in this Privacy Statement.</p><p><br></p><p>3.

For example, Coozilla may contract with third parties to host the Service or provide the Service.</p><p><br></p><p>Coozilla may also use and disclose Personal Information (including the content of your communications) to comply with the law and lawful requests or legal process, enforce the terms and policies governing your use of the Service, including investigations of any potential violation, to detect or prevent security breaches, fraud or technical issues, to protect the rights or property of Coozilla and its customers, and when Coozilla believes in good faith that the disclosure is necessary to protect the personal safety of Coozilla, its employees and customers or the public.</p><p><br></p><p>Also, Coozilla may disclose Personal Information in connection with (but not limited to) the following circumstances:</p><p><br></p><p>Co-Branded Services</p><p><br></p><p>Some services in connection with the Service may be co-branded and offered together with another company. If you register for or use these services, both Coozilla and the other company may receive your Personal Information collected in connection with the co-branded services.</p><p><br></p><p>Other Purposes</p><p><br></p><p>Coozilla may disclose personal information as consented to by you from time to time, including to fulfil any other purposes that are identified when the Personal Information is collected.</p><p><br></p><p>Coozilla will not use or disclose Personal Information for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with your consent or as required or permitted by law. Consent may be express or implied, and given in writing, by using or not using a check-off box, electronically, orally, or by your conduct, such as use of services or products.</p><p><br></p><p>4.

Coozilla and the third party service providers that provide hosting services for the Service use a variety of security technologies and administrative procedures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure with security measures appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.

Third Party Sites and Services</p><p><br></p><p>The Service may contain links to third-party websites, products and services, such as social networking sites and third parties who may offer additional products and services through the Service. Information collected by third parties, which may include information such as location data and contact details, is governed by the third parties' privacy practices.</p><p><br></p><p>9. Changes to this Statement</p><p><br></p><p>This Statement is effective as of the effective date at the top of this Statement. Coozilla may periodically update this Statement to reflect changes in its practices or applicable laws or regulations. If Coozilla updates this Statement, Coozilla will post the updated version of this Statement and it will change the “effective date” at the top of this Statement.
